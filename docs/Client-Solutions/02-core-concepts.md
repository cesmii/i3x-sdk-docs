# Core Concepts

## Core Concepts

### Smart Manufacturing Profiles (SM Profiles)

SM Profiles are OPC UA Information Model type definitions that describe:
- Equipment characteristics
- Identification metadata
- Runtime data structure
- Behavioral contracts

Applications interact with instances of these profiles through the API, enabling semantic understanding of manufacturing entities.

### Contextualized Data

The API provides access to data that has been:
- Properly structured according to information models
- Tagged with appropriate metadata
- Organized within hierarchical relationships
- Timestamped and quality-assured
