# Client Developer Guide - Overview

## Overview

The i3X API provides a standardized interface for accessing and manipulating manufacturing data across diverse platforms. This guide is designed for application developers building clients that consume the API to create analytics, visualizations, notifications, and machine learning applications.

These documents are a companion to the formal [Implementation Guide](https://github.com/cesmii/i3X/blob/1.0-Beta/spec/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md). If there are differences between the two, the Implementation Guide should be considered authoritative; please report any errors you observe.

## Purpose and Scope

i3x aims to solve the fragmentation problem in manufacturing information systems by providing a common set of server primitives that enable application portability across different platform implementations. This means you can write your application once and deploy it against any platform that implements this API specification.

### Key Benefits for Client Developers

- **Platform Independence**: Build applications that work across multiple manufacturing information platforms
- **Standardized Interface**: Consistent API contracts reduce integration complexity
- **Contextualized Data**: Access to properly structured and contextualized manufacturing data
- **Application Portability**: Deploy the same application across different manufacturing environments

## Architecture Context

i3X operates within the application layer of the manufacturing technology stack:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Applications (Your Client)        │
│   - Analytics                       │
│   - Visualization                   │
│   - ML/AI                           │
│   - Notifications                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

│   Platform Layer                    │
│   (Historian/MES/MOM/EMI/Broker)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The API assumes that data has already been contextualized by underlying platform functions, making it ready for consumption by applications. If a combination of platforms is used, the API assumes those packages are using a unified information model (Namespaces).

## Getting Started

### Demo Environment

A public endpoint is available for testing and development:

- **Base URL**: `https://api.i3x.dev/v1`
- **Documentation**: `https://api.i3x.dev/v1/docs`

### Prerequisites

Before you begin developing against the i3X, ensure you have:

1. Understanding of RESTful API principles
2. Familiarity with manufacturing data concepts
3. Understanding of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
4. Knowledge of OPC UA Information Models (recommended)
5. Understanding of Smart Manufacturing Profiles (recommended)
